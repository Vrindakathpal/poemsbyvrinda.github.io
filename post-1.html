          <p>For I wonder from an ocean of dreams which ones finally do come true and why do they get picked and who picks them by the way? </p>
              
          <p>If there is a system that I don’t know about that secret WhatsApp group or that messenger ID that’s considered to be fake or that one book on that one shelf in that one library that has this magical answer could you let me know?</p>
         
          <p>Because I want to make that one drop that I threw into the ocean meet that sordid lonely glass filled with people who got their dreams just like that….</p>
 

<p>For I wonder from that canopy of trees filled with influential social media stars who gets picked? </p>
      
               
        <p>Why would you be heard and I would be ignored and reported as a spam account but basically I did just like 1500 comments on a Tom and Jerry post?</p>

          <p>Why would you be the ones that become the green falling leaves that  were destined to be caught by those curious children Who just wanted to escape from their house and still play outdoors in the sun ? </p>
          <p>For I wonder from all those huge mountains that seem unreachable and that one in the middle filled with snow and covered with clouds why do only a few of us wish to climb that peak of peace?</p>
          <p>Who wish to slow down and look out the window of a car When the car isnt moving, who wish to not compete in the race but change the fact that life does not need to be a race and believe in the fact that you and me can just be we! </p>
          <p>For I wonder if wondering is all I would ever do and would that wonderment actually ever change anything?</p>
          <p>Would me thinking and believing make you listen to me when you are still listening to that one gramophone that is still playing that broken record of how everything has to be perfect, how every moment needs to be a success and how every person needs to be an achievement.....</p>
          <p>For I wonder that my question on this wondement will make you see that maybe wondering isn’t actually that bad....maybe you don’t need to be perfect and I just need to be me!</p>
          <p>Or maybe you’re still wearing those glasses  that makes you see that the ocean is full of losers and not dreamers, that canopy is full of rotten expectations and not unidentified destinations and that mountain as too hard to climb!
</p>
          <p>And as I wonder for I wonder if wandering in my wonderment is the best mistake for I am not wrong and not right but I’m just wondering for I can wonder......</p>
